File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 12, characters 23-25:
Error: Syntax error

Solution: "match n of" should be changed to "match n with"

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 13, characters 6-8:
Error: Syntax error

Solution: "=>" should be "->"

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 14, characters 6-8:
Error: Syntax error

Solution: "=>" should still be '->'

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 30, characters 4-5:
Error: Syntax error

Solution: there needs to be a "|" before the pattern matching statement.

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 12, characters 21-22:
Error: Unbound value n

Solution: The function declaration doesn't specify a variable, just a type.
	Should be rewritten as "let dble (n: int)..."

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 14, characters 14-18:
Error: Unbound value dble

Solution: The function dble isn't refined recursively so OCaml can't find anything named dble.
	"let" should become "let rec."

File "hw1-fixme.ml", line 30, characters 16-25:
Error: Unbound value factorial

Solution: There is no function named factorial. Change it to "fact" to match the function name.

File "C:/Users/Alex/Downloads/COMP 302 hw1 code/hw1-fixme.ml", line 30, characters 15-29:
Error: This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type
         int

Solution: If n = 0, it returns 1.0, so I changed it to return 1.

Everything runs now!
